# Match! Explore the World

This is a simple memory card game I created for my Computing 2: Applications module coursework.
It contains a proforma which records my detailed intentions and methods of creating this project. 

This is a web app with a client server architecture. 

Html, CSS and JS were used for the front-end;
JS, NeDB (subset of MongoDB) were used for the back-end; 
Mocha Test was used for the test files. 

Disclaimer: Please pardon some of the bugs if you encounter them, my test file is kinda trash cause idk how to test properly.
Also please don't mind the useless "scoreboard" page; I couldn't figure out how to arrange the scores in ascending order and display them nicely like a regular game scoreboard before my coursework deadline. 

Just putting this up here to record my work.

Cheers :)
